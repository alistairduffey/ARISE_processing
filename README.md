Main.ipynb contains code to process ARISE, ssp245 and PiCOntrol runs in UKESM1 into time means, and ensemble means/stds. It outputs small .nc files (0.5Mb per variable per scenario) of spatial fields to /Output_data 

Main.ipynb needs to be run on JASMIN because file paths are specific to the CEDA archive.
